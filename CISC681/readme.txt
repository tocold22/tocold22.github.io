This is a simple framework you can use for developing and testing
your threejs framework. To use the framework, run show1.html in a browser and include the address of your program as a query string under the 'load' parameter. For example: 

show1.html?load=js/triangle015.js

You can add your programs to the js folder and run them; you can also 
add javascript programs to the other folders as well.

Programs that require resources may not run from your file system due to permission restrictions. This is true, for example, of programs that load font or texture resources. To run ALL programs, you can either relax security restrictions in your browser or run your files from a local web server. For that, here are some useful links:

The three.js programs from my graphics site https://sites.nova.edu/mjl/graphics/ will run under this framework.
